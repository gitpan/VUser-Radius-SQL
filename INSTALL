Required Modules: 

VUser-Radius-SQL requires the following modules that are not included with Perl:
- vuser 0.2.0 or greater
- DBI

Basic Installation:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

That will install vuser on your system in /usr (or /usr/local) by default.
You can define a different install path by setting PREFIX when running
Makefile.PL. For example, to install vuser in your home directory

        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~

or to install in /opt

        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/opt

The install script will create lib, share and sbin directories in PREFIX.

If you install in a PREFIX that is not included in perl's default library
paths, you will need to set PERL5LIB to include the new directory. For
example, if you set PREFIX=/opt, you might add this to your .profile (or
/etc/profile).

        export PERL5LIB=/opt/lib/perl5/site_perl/
